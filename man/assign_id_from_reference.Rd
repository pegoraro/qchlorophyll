\name{assign_id_from_reference}
\alias{assign_id_from_reference}
\title{This function is used to assign an id to the interpolated obsevartions based on
the reference dataframe used in the interpolation process.}
\usage{
assign_id_from_reference(df, reference_df, coordinates = c("lon", "lat"),
  id_name = "id_pixel", arrange_order = c("id_pixel", "id_date"))
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dplyr dataframe to be assigned an id according to a
reference dataframe.}

\item{reference_df}{dataframe containing at least the following variables:
longitude, latitude and id_pixel (a unique identifier for each pixel).}

\item{coordinates}{names of spatial coordinates latitude and longitude in the reference dataframe}

\item{id_name}{name of the unique identifier in the reference dataframe}

\item{arrange_order}{how to arrange the output? Default: by id_pixel, then by id_date.}
}
\value{
Returns a dplyr dataframe
}
\description{
This function should be used as the last step of the following process:
1) Data is loaded in raw form using one of the available options (load_all_as_list or
load_nc_with_time).
3) If the loading process is performed using load_all_as_list, cropping of the selected
geographical area can be then performed using the crop_selected_area function. In case the loading
process is perfomed with the function load_nc_with_time the cropping is performed at load time.
2) Interpolation is performed to obtain a different resolution of the spatial images based
on a given reference dataframe.
3) The function assign_id_from_reference can be finally used to match the id_pixel in the reference
dataframe to each pair of longitude and latitude.
